## What it is

Built a minimal OS from scratch for the Raspberry Pi 4. Implements basic kernel functionality including process scheduling, virtual memory, device drivers, and a simple shell.

## What I learned

- ARM64 architecture and assembly programming
- Bare metal programming without standard libraries
- Device tree and hardware initialization
- Writing device drivers for UART, GPIO, and timer

## What can be improved

- Add FAT32 filesystem support for SD card access
- Implement preemptive multitasking
- Add USB stack for keyboard and mouse input
- Create a basic windowing system and GUI
