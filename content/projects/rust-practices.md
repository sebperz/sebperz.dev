# Rust Practices
[github repo](https://github.com/sebperz/rust-practices)
The first step on my way to learn Rust is the Rust Book, but you have to code to really learn, and this is this GitHub repo.
I'm going to create a variety of little programs to get familiar with Rust, and in the way I'm learning alongside my friend [serigu](https://github.com/jsrg26), we embark in this Rust journey in parallel, and build these projects while chatting alongside, this way we can share bugs, knowledge and discoveries while building.

## What I Learned
In simple words: Rust, these are my first immersion into the language, if you're interested in the specific things that I learned in every project, you can check them up, there is a "What I Learned" section in every directory.

## What can be improved
The same as the last section, in every directory is a section dedicated to the things that can be improved in every project. Thanks to doing them in parallel with a friend we gather a lot of different ways to solve the same problem.
