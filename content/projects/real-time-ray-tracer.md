## What it is

A real-time ray tracing engine that leverages NVIDIA RTX cores through Vulkan ray tracing extensions. Features include global illumination, soft shadows, and physically-based materials.

## What I learned

- Ray tracing algorithms and acceleration structures (BVH)
- Vulkan API and ray tracing pipeline
- CUDA kernel optimization and memory management
- Physically-based rendering (PBR) principles

## What can be improved

- Add denoising filters for better image quality
- Implement adaptive sampling for faster convergence
- Add support for dynamic scenes with refitting BVH
- Create a node-based material editor
